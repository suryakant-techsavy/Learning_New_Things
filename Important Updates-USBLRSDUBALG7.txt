Hi @ashish ,




Actually I wanted to say "Thank you!" for the valuable feedback you provided and I have started working on the points you mentioned.
I have a few additional points I would like to discuss:
AWS Integrations Training: I am keen to enhance my skills in AWS Integration and have completed the necessary survey for the training. Could you please review and approve it if required?
Performance Ratings: Since joining Deloitte three years ago, I have consistently received positive feedback indicating continuous improvement. However, my ratings have consistently been marked as "Agree," which has resulted in a commensurate rating during the Year-End Review every year. I would appreciate it if we could discuss the possibility of a higher rating that accurately reflects my continuous contributions and continuous growth.
ONL Flag Status: During our last check-in call, Rahul mentioned that I am effectively managing tasks related to new-comers handling and the J17-CH2 project. He indicated that the ONL flag would be enabled for me. Could you please confirm if this has been done?
I look forward to your response.
